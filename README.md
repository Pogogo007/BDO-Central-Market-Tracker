# Major Update. The Tool no longer requires tokens. It can now also monitor price changes for items on the market and warn you whenever the price goes higher or lower than your set amount

## Setup
# Download the program from the releases tab. Make Sure to Extract The Folder


1. Set your region in the settings. EU or NA only.
2. Get the ids for the item you want to track and place them in the settings in the correct format.I have put examples ids in the settings already. BDOCodex has the IDS for most      items in the game. You will find it in the address bar
3. Modify delay between checks. In seconds. `DO NOT PUT THIS TOO LOW.` Otherwise the program may not be able to do its checks correctly and PA may block your account from accessing the website temporarely. 30 Seconds is fine for most people
4. Choose wether to monitor prices or trade counts.
5. If you chose prices choose your warning price after names.json generates. The file will generate on first launch. Leave at 0 to disable warnings
6. Run the EXE
